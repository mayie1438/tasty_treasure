            <h2>What is Spaghetti Carbonara?</h2>
            <p>Spaghetti Carbonara is a traditional Italian pasta dish originating from Rome. 
                Itâ€™s made with eggs, Pecorino Romano cheese, guanciale (or pancetta), and pepper, 
                creating a rich, creamy sauce without using cream. The dish is known for its 
                simplicity, with the sauce relying on the heat from the pasta to cook the eggs.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>400g spaghetti</li>
        <li>150g guanciale (or pancetta), diced</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
        <li>100g Pecorino Romano cheese, grated</li>
        <li>1 tsp freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Salt (for boiling the pasta)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Boil the water:</strong> In a large pot, bring 4 liters of water to a rolling boil. Add about 1 tablespoon of salt (the water should taste like the sea). This is essential for properly seasoning the pasta.</li>

        <li><strong>Cook the spaghetti:</strong> Add the spaghetti to the boiling water and cook until al dente (firm to the bite). This usually takes around 8-10 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent the pasta from sticking together.</li>

        <li><strong>Prepare the guanciale:</strong> While the pasta is cooking, heat a large pan over medium heat. Add the diced guanciale (or pancetta) and cook for 5-6 minutes until crispy and golden. Avoid adding extra oil, as the fat from the guanciale will render naturally. Once crispy, turn off the heat and set the pan aside.</li>

        <li><strong>Whisk the egg mixture:</strong> In a mixing bowl, whisk together the 2 whole eggs, 1 egg yolk, grated Pecorino Romano cheese, and freshly ground black pepper. Whisk until the mixture becomes smooth and thick. This will form the base of the creamy sauce.</li>

        <li><strong>Reserve pasta water:</strong> When the pasta is nearly done, scoop out 1/2 cup of the starchy pasta water and set it aside. This water will help adjust the consistency of the sauce.</li>

        <li><strong>Drain the pasta:</strong> Drain the cooked spaghetti but do not rinse it. The starch on the surface of the pasta will help the sauce cling to it better.</li>

        <li><strong>Combine pasta with guanciale:</strong> Immediately add the hot spaghetti to the pan with the crispy guanciale. Toss well to coat the pasta in the rendered fat.</li>

        <li><strong>Make the sauce:</strong> Remove the pan from the heat to prevent the eggs from scrambling. Slowly pour the egg mixture over the pasta, stirring continuously to create a silky sauce. The residual heat from the pasta will cook the eggs without curdling them.</li>

        <li><strong>Adjust the sauce consistency:</strong> If the sauce is too thick, gradually add a little of the reserved pasta water, one tablespoon at a time, until it reaches the desired creamy consistency.</li>

        <li><strong>Season and serve:</strong> Taste the pasta and add more black pepper if needed. Transfer the carbonara to serving plates and sprinkle extra Pecorino Romano on top for added flavor.</li>
