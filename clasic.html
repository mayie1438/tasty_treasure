            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>500g ground beef (80% lean, 20% fat)</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>4 sesame seed buns, toasted</li>
        <li>4 slices cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>4 lettuce leaves</li>
        <li>8 tomato slices</li>
        <li>1/2 red onion, sliced</li>
        <li>Pickles (optional)</li>
        <li>Ketchup and mustard, to taste</li>
        <li>Butter (for toasting buns)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Prepare the patties:</strong> In a bowl, mix the ground beef with salt and pepper. Divide the meat into 4 equal portions and shape into patties, slightly larger than the buns (they will shrink during cooking).</li>

        <li><strong>Cook the patties:</strong> Heat a grill or skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the patties for 3-4 minutes on each side for medium doneness, or adjust cooking time to your preference.</li>

        <li><strong>Add the cheese:</strong> During the last minute of cooking, place a slice of cheddar cheese on each patty. Cover with a lid or foil to help the cheese melt.</li>

        <li><strong>Toast the buns:</strong> Spread a little butter on the cut sides of the buns and toast them on the grill or skillet until golden brown.</li>

        <li><strong>Assemble the burger:</strong> Place a lettuce leaf on the bottom bun, followed by a cheesy beef patty, two tomato slices, onion rings, and pickles (if using). Add ketchup and mustard to the top bun and place it over the patty.</li>

        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Pair the burgers with fries and extra condiments. Enjoy while hot!</li>
