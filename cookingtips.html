        <h3>1. Mise en Place: The Key to Success</h3>
        <img src="mise.jpg" alt="Mise en Place" class="tip-image">
        <p><strong>Tip</strong>: Before you start cooking, gather and prepare all your ingredients. This means chopping vegetables, measuring spices, and having all your tools ready.</p>

        <h3>2. Invest in Quality Knives</h3>
        <img src="invest.jpg" alt="Quality Knives" class="tip-image">
        <p><strong>Tip</strong>: A good chef’s knife can make a world of difference. Keep it sharp and learn how to use it properly to enhance your chopping skills.</p>

        <h3>3. Understand Cooking Techniques</h3>
        <img src="techniques.jpg" alt="Cooking Techniques" class="tip-image">
        <p><strong>Tip</strong>: Familiarize yourself with basic cooking techniques like sautéing, roasting, boiling, and grilling. Each technique can dramatically change the flavor and texture of your food.</p>

        <h3>4. Seasoning is Everything</h3>
        <img src="seasoning.jpg" alt="Seasoning" class="tip-image">
        <p><strong>Tip</strong>: Don't be afraid to experiment with herbs and spices. Taste your food as you cook and adjust seasoning accordingly.</p>

        <p><strong>Tip</strong>: When sautéing or frying, give your ingredients space. Overcrowding can cause steaming instead of browning, leading to less flavor.</p>

        <h3>6. Let Meat Rest</h3>
        <img src="r1.jfif" alt="Let Meat Rest" class="tip-image">
        <p><strong>Tip</strong>: After cooking, let your meat rest for a few minutes before slicing. This allows juices to redistribute, resulting in a more tender bite.</p>

        <h3>7. Use Fresh Ingredients</h3>
        <img src="ingredients.jpg" alt="Fresh Ingredients" class="tip-image">
        <p><strong>Tip</strong>: Whenever possible, use fresh produce and meats. They not only taste better but also provide more nutrients.</p>

        <h3>8. Keep Your Kitchen Organized</h3>

        <h3>9. Taste as You Go</h3>
