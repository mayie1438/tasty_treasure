            <h2>What is Broken Lasagna?</h2>
            <p>
                Broken lasagna is a comforting twist on traditional lasagna. Instead of layering sheets of pasta, this recipe utilizes broken lasagna noodles for a more rustic presentation. It’s perfect for those who enjoy the flavors of lasagna without the fuss of precise layering.

                <li>24 oz marinara sauce</li>
                <li>15 oz ricotta cheese</li>
                <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
                <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>1 egg</li>
                <li>2 tsp Italian seasoning</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
                <li>Fresh basil or parsley for garnish (optional)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the Oven:
                    Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
                <li>Cook the Noodles:
                    Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the broken lasagna noodles and cook according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
                <li>Prepare the Meat Sauce:
                    In a large skillet over medium heat, add the ground beef or sausage. Cook until browned, breaking it apart with a spatula. Drain excess fat if necessary.
                    
                    Add the chopped onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute.
                    
                    Pour in the marinara sauce and let simmer for 5-10 minutes. Season with Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper.</li>
                <li>Mix the Ricotta:
                    In a bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, a pinch of salt, and a little pepper. Mix until smooth.</li>
                <li>Assemble the Dish:
                    In a large baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom. Layer half of the broken lasagna noodles over the sauce.
                    
                    Dollop half of the ricotta mixture over the noodles and sprinkle with a third of the mozzarella cheese. Add another layer of meat sauce, followed by the remaining noodles, the rest of the ricotta mixture, and another layer of meat sauce.
                    
                    Finish by topping with the remaining mozzarella and all of the Parmesan cheese.</li>
                <li>ABake:
                    Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden.
                    
                    </li>
                <li>Cool and Serve:
                    Let the broken lasagna cool for about 10 minutes before serving. Garnish with fresh basil or parsley if desired.
                    
                    </li>
            </ol>
