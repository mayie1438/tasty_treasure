            <h2>What is Potato and Leek Soup?</h2>
            <p>Potato and Leek Soup is a comforting, creamy soup with a mild onion flavor from the leeks and a smooth texture from potatoes. 
                It's a traditional dish in many parts of Europe, especially France, where it's known as 'Potage Parmentier.' 
                This simple soup is often served warm, accompanied by crusty bread for dipping.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>3 large leeks (white and light green parts), sliced</li>
        <li>4 medium potatoes, peeled and diced</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 liter vegetable or chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream (optional for extra richness)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>Chopped chives, for garnish</li>
        <li>Olive oil, for drizzling</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Prepare the leeks:</strong> Slice the leeks and rinse thoroughly to remove any dirt between the layers.</li>
        <li><strong>Saut√© the vegetables:</strong> In a large pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and leeks, and cook for 5-7 minutes until soft but not browned.</li>
        <li><strong>Add potatoes and broth:</strong> Add the diced potatoes to the pot and pour in the vegetable or chicken broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover and simmer for 20-25 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender.</li>
        <li><strong>Blend the soup:</strong> Use an immersion blender to puree the soup until smooth. If you don't have one, carefully transfer the soup in batches to a blender and blend until creamy.</li>
        <li><strong>Add cream (optional):</strong> Stir in the heavy cream for extra richness and heat the soup gently without boiling.</li>
        <li><strong>Season:</strong> Add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with chopped chives. Drizzle olive oil on top for extra flavor.</li>
