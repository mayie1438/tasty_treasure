                <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>4 cups vegetable or chicken broth</li>
                <li>1 cup coconut milk (or heavy cream)</li>
                <li>2 tbsp olive oil or butter</li>
                <li>1 tsp ground ginger (or 1 tbsp fresh ginger, grated)</li>
                <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp nutmeg</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
                <li>Fresh herbs (like thyme or parsley) for garnish</li>
                <li>Pumpkin seeds for topping (optional)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare the Pumpkin:
                    Cut the pumpkin in half, scoop out the seeds, and peel the skin. Cut the pumpkin into cubes.</li>
                <li>Sauté the Aromatics:
                    In a large pot, heat the olive oil or butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until soft and translucent, about 5-7 minutes. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.</li>
                <li>Cook the Pumpkin:
                    Add the cubed pumpkin to the pot, along with the ground ginger, cumin, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Stir to coat the pumpkin in the spices. Cook for about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add Broth:
                    Pour in the vegetable or chicken broth, bringing the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 20-25 minutes, or until the pumpkin is tender.</li>
                <li>Blend the Soup:
                    Using an immersion blender, carefully blend the soup until smooth. If you don’t have an immersion blender, you can transfer the soup to a countertop blender in batches.</li>
                <li>Add Coconut Milk:
                    Stir in the coconut milk (or heavy cream) to add creaminess. Heat the soup for an additional 5 minutes, adjusting the seasoning with salt and pepper as needed.</li>
                <li>Serve:
                    Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with fresh herbs and pumpkin seeds if desired.</li>
            </ol>
